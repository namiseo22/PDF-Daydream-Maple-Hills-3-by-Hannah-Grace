And now with his new role as ice hockey captain ? which he didn?t even want ? Henry absolutely cannot fail. Enter Halle Jacobs, a fellow junior who finds herself befriended by Henry when he accidentally crashes her book club.Halle may not have the romantic pursuits of her favorite fictional leads, but she?s an academic superstar, and when she hears about Henry?s problems with his class reading material, she offers to help. But being a private tutor isn?t exactly ideal given her own studies, job and the novel she?s trying to write. New experiences are the key to beating her writer?s block, though, and Henry?s promising to be the one to give them to her.They just need to stick to their rulebook. Oh, and not fall in love.18+ content</p>
